        Marine forests of macroalgae and seagrass create essential habitats for coastal species and support invaluable ecological services. We provide species richness estimates of kelp, fucoid and seagrass biomes, by using species distribution models (stacked SDMs) linking occurrence records with relevant environmental predictors (i.e., light, temperature, salinity, nitrate, wave energy and ice coverage).

        <br><br>

        The mapped biodiversity can serve as new baselines for planning and prioritizing locations for conservation, management and climate change mitigation strategies.

      Species richness of kelps is higher in the north-east Pacific (maximum 32 species), supporting the hypothesis that these regions were the evolutionary sources of global colonization. Locations with low species richness are mainly at higher latitudes (e.g., Siberia) and the Baltic Sea, where extensive ice coverage and low-salinity regimes prevail. Regions of high endemism for both groups were identified in the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, South Africa and East Russia.

      Higher species richness of fucoids was found in south-east Australia (maximum 53 species), supporting the hypothesis that these regions were the evolutionary sources of global colonization. Locations with low species richness are mainly at higher latitudes (e.g., Siberia) and the Baltic Sea, where extensive ice coverage and low-salinity regimes prevail.

      The highest regional species richness for kelp was found in the north-east Pacific (maximum 32 species) and for fucoids in south-east Australia (maximum 53 species), supporting the hypothesis that these regions were the evolu-tionary sources of global colonization by brown macroalgae. Locations with low spe-cies richness coincided between kelp and fucoid, occurring mainly at higher latitudes (e.g., Siberia) and the Baltic Sea, where extensive ice coverage and low-salinity regimes prevail. Regions of high endemism for both groups were identified in the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, South Africa and East Russia.
