In a world where climate change is altering the global biodiversity patterns faster than we can keep track of, it is critical to establish current baseline conditions to support well-informed biodiversity assessments and effective conservation management. For the marine environment, however, such information is often unavailable.

In this publication, we identify the main environmental drivers shaping the distribution of 420 species of marine forests and map their global biodiversity patterns.

We find regions of high species richness along the northeast Pacific and southeast Australia coasts and low species richness at high latitudes. Endemicity centers were identified in the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, South Africa and East Russia. Overall, we find biodiversity patterns in line with hypotheses of the evolutionary origin of the species.
